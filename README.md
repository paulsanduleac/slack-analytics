# Google Analytics to Slack

A small tool that gets announces one or more metrics from Google Analytics on Slack via incoming webhooks. 
Right now it is capable of authenticating with your GA account, listing your accounts and web properties (the latter only in console), still has to be finished. 

## To do:
- list accounts, web properties, profiles
- allow user to select profile by clicking (as easy as possible)
- let user enter Slack Webhook URL, Slack Payload options, Google's Client ID
